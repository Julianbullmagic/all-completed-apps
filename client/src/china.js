Capitalist historians would have us believe that the People's Republic of China experimented with Socialism for a few decades between 1949 and 1978, until finally realising that Capitalism was clearly superior to Communism and adopted a free market capitalist economy. Supposedly, all of China's problems resulted from Socialism and the huge progress China has made since the 1980s is entirely a result of Capitalism. This narrative is very misleading. It ignores the huge progress and growth made within Communist China prior to 1978. It excludes the fact that Communist leadership set China free from ruthless European Imperialism and Feudal Serfdom, that the standard of living, social and economic inequality dramatically reduced under Chairman Mao's Leadership. The status of women was greatly elevated, the commune system was organised in such a way as to liberate women from the need to perform unpaid domestic labour, the slavery of housework. Rates of female employment, university enrolment and leadership greatly increased (like most other socialist revolutions). Standards of health and education improved very substantially. The situation in China at the time of the Chinese revolution in 1949 was substantially worse than in Eastern Europe where the Soviet Revolution had occurred. Pre-communist China was one of the poorest countries in the world. Despite dramatic improvements, the poverty of the People's Republic persisted for several decades. In the late 1970s China was still far behind the Soviet Union and the First World countries in terms of development and wealth per capita. Gross Domestic Product per capita in the Soviet Union was 28 times higher than China, very few chinese people owned cars, televisions or even access to electricity. In order to address this problem more rapidly, the Communist government made some pragmatic compromises, allowing foreign capitalists to invest in China. This created an inflow of new technology that has greatly helped to increase productivity and efficiency. The countries of the former Soviet Union that have all adopted a Bourgeois type of parliament, heavily influenced by money and political lobbying, however China has retained a strong communist government that is much more resistant to corruption (although not completely). The communist party creates long term economic plans that allow them achieve huge goals that Capitalist governments are simply incapable of doing. Since the pro-capitalist reforms China has experienced the most rapid and consistent period of economic growth and poverty alleviation of any country in human history. No other country even comes sort of close. Yes China does now have some capitalist businesses, however the majority of their economy is still socialised, public enterprises and worker co-operatives.

    <p>
The 1949 Communist Revolution brought enormous improvements to China. In the first five year economic plan industrial production increased 420%, capital goods increased 570%, steel production 1300% and cement 700%. They constructed 1900 new types of machines. The initial priority was industrialising as quickly as possible in order to improve the standard of living of the population (ref #1, ref #2). The work day became restricted to 8 hours, real wages tended to increase and working conditions improved. There was a steady elimination of illiteracy. The status of women improved dramatically. Most entered the workforce, equal pay for equal work was introduced. At the grassroots organisational level, in factories, farms, neighbourhood committees, female party members frequently outnumbered men. There were also substantial efforts to include women in the upper party echelons, up to 10% in 1973 while previously there had been zero. Birth control devices were distributed by the government without charge by the women's federation. The commune system attempted to eliminate the need for women to do unpaid housework. Traditionally female domestic labour such as cooking, laundering, sewing and childcare were performed by communal institutions (ref #3, ref#4). The land redistribution reforms specified that women were entitled to an equal allotment of land as men. Female enrolment in University increased substantially, for example at the North China Revolutionary People's University near Beijing, 30% of students were women by 1949. Many nurseries were established to help raise children and 45 days paid maternity leave was introduced. Slavery, child sales and exploitation of child labour were made illegal. There was a distinct improvement in the mortality rate among infants and mothers. Polygamy, concubinage, prostitution, the sale of women, marriage arranged by parents without voluntary agreement of the parties all became illegal. Women gained an equal right to divorce (ref #5).
    </p>
    <p>
    For the first decade of the Chinese revolution, substantial progress was made in improving the standards of living and education. The Communist party had successfully unified China into a strong that had assumed a place of primary importance in the strategic thinking of world superpowers. However, in the second decade after the 1949 revolution, there was a period of relative stagnation. There have only been two, relatively short periods of negative economic growth in the history of the People's Republic of China, a few years following The Great Leap Forward of 1959 and a few more years following the Cultural Revolution 1967. For most of the history of Communism in this country, the trend has been quite strong and steady economic growth (ref #6). In the early years, Chairman Mao closely imitated the Stalinist approach to Socialism, very rapid, somewhat forceful industrialisation. It was understood that while this may have been less than ideal, alleviating poverty by increasing the productive forces of society was a greater priority. However, after the first decade, the communist party decided to conduct some social experiments in order to try to find a more democratic form of socialism. This proved to have some disastrous economic results, and these mistakes were soon rectified. On balance, however, even during the worst periods the country retained a certain cohesiveness and sense of national unity. The charisma of Mao Tse-tung remained a strong unifying influence (ref #6). There were some famines during the early years of the Chinese revolution because the country had been a poor feudal society prior to 1949. All feudal societies experience famines every few years, their technology is not advanced enough to ensure a constant stable supply of food (ref #7, ref #8, ref #9). The communist party could not just snap their fingers and suddenly and magically fix everything that was wrong with China. It took time to develop socialism. Despite their mistakes, the overall trend has been dramatic increases in life expectancy, improvements to the standards of health and nutrition, and a decline in the rate of death. This was particularly true during the leadership of Chairman Mao (ref #10, ref #11, ref #12, ref #13). The claim that Chairman Mao killed millions of innocent people is slander spread as Capitalist anti-Communist propaganda.
    </p>
    <p>
    Despite all the improvements delivered by Socialism in China, by the late 1970s, poverty was still widespread. Gross Domestic Product Per Capita was still only twenty times lower than the Soviet Union and 50 times lower than Australia (ref #14, ref #15, ref #16). In 1978, the successor to Chairman Mao, Deng Xiaoping, introduced a series of pro-market reforms, that allowed some foreign Capitalist investment and opening up to international trade. This has resulted in the most rapid and consistent period of economic growth of any country in human history by far, averaging 10% GDP growth per-capita for four decades straight (ref #17, ref #18, ref #19). Peoples' incomes have increased dramatically (ref #20). The cost of living is also relatively cheap compared with Capitalist countries like Australia, data gathered by numerous crowd sourced cost-of-living web sites confirm this conclusion (ref #21, ref #22, ref #23, ref #24, ref #25).
    </p>
    <p>
    In the Capitalist media, China is frequently misrepresented as having a tyrannical authoritarian government. In reality, the population greatly appreciate the enormous improvements that have been delivered by the communist party and mostly co-operate with their leadership. One study performed by academics at Harvard University found that 95% of Chinese people are satisfied with the communist party (ref #26). Chinese police usually don't carry guns (ref #27, ref #28) while Australian police usually do carry guns (ref #29, ref #30). The rate of imprisonment per capita is about a quarter lower than Australia (ref #31). China has quite a participatory form of democracy with extensive consultation and discussion between the people and the government. All laws require public consultation before they can be approved (ref #32, ref #33, ref #34, ref #35). In a study conducted by Chinese academic Li Yao, released in 2017, the majority of protests which were non-controversial did not receive much if any negative police action, which is to say police may have been present but in no more capacity than Western police would be attending to a protest/mass gathering event. The idea that Chinese do not protest or would be brutally repressed for any kind of political action does not seem to be supported by existing data (ref #36).

    In recent years, two separate factions have appeared in the Australian communist movement, the party split into the Communist Party of Australia (CPA) and the Australian communist party (ACP). One of the main points of disagreement is over whether or not to support China. The ACP believe that China has devolved into capitalism, it has become a social democracy like the Scandinavian countries. They believe this means that the high standard of living that has been achieved for the Chinese population is a result of imperialism, the exploitation of working class people in foreign countries. Real socialism is internationalist, favouring equality and mutual respect between countries. In socialism the worker class at the dominant class in society, in social democracy, a Capitalist oligarchy is dominant, however they have made large concessions to the working class within their own country. This view is incorrect, China's relationships with other countries are much more humanistic. The People's Republic has undoubtedly taken on some capitalistic characteristics, economic inequality has increased and there are more capitalist businesses now, however, the Working class are still the dominant class. China is the reverse of social democracy. Social-democracy is the Bourgoisie making some concessions to the working class that ultimately allow them to stay dominant, it placates the working class, China is the opposite of this. Globally, the Bourgoise are still the dominant class and this has forced The CPC to make some concessions, economic isolationism is a recipe for poverty and catastrophe. China forms mutually beneficial partnerships with other countries and does not try to dominate, control or exploit them. For the last few hundred years, the Scandinavian countries have engaged in the same kind of militaristic and ruthless imperialism that other European countries such as Britain and France have also engaged in. The Scandinavian countries have dozens of foreign military bases and have been involved in dozens of aggressive wars since World War Two (ref #37, ref #38, ref  #39, ref #40, ref #41, ref #42, ref #43). Since the founding of the People’s Republic, China has never started a single war or conflict, and has never taken one inch of land from other countries. China has only engaged in military conflicts for the purpose of defending territory that has historically been a part of Modern China for longer than most of the modern nation states of Europe and America have even existed. The former US president Jimmy Carter made not of how the People's Republic is much less militaristic than the USA while talking to Donald Trump, “Since 1979, do you know how many times China has been at war with anybody? None. And we have stayed at war"(ref #44, ref #45). The western media often alleges that China has tried to expand it's territory into regions such as Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the South China Sea. The Qing Dynasty of China conquered Xinjiang in 1759 and has been a region of China for most of that time (ref #46) Tibet has been a part of China for most of the period since 1720 (ref #47, ref #48) China has been involved in the regions of the South China Sea that it claims for thousands of years, they were the first to map, settle and use the natural resources. There is an extensive historical and archaeological record that confirms this (ref #49). Taiwant has been a part of China for most of the time since 1683 (ref #50) Hong Kong has been a part of China for most of the time since 221BC (ref #51). The concept of Hong Kong and Taiwan being separate, independent countries is a very new one, Hong Kong is only thought of as independent because it was colonised and conquered by the British in 1841. China only has one military base outside of it's own historical territories, a base in the east African Country of Djibouti, and only since 2017. This is largely for the purpose of preventing piracy in the Indian Ocean and defending Chinese trade ships passing through the Red Sea. They were only able to build the base with the agreement of the Djibouti government, as do many other countries (ref #52, ref #53, ref #54). Imperialism is a coercive, tyrannical, exploitative relationship where one country dominates another. China's relationships with other countries are simply not like this, their economic support in the third world countries has brought enormous economic growth. An imperialist country will try to weaken and control their subject countries as much as possible. China has objectively helped numerous countries to develop, grow and strengthen. The goal is to form mutually beneficial partnerships that make both countries' stronger (ref #55, ref #56). The People's Republic has also shown great leniency with the terms of their investment, there are many examples of them renegotiating loans or providing debt relief when countries have struggled to pay (ref #57, ref #58). They have forgiven $10 billion in debt to third world countries (ref #59). Capitalist countries enforce property rights with the violence of the state. The fact that China doesn't have military bases in almost all the countries they invest in gives those countries a substantial level of power. They could decide to not repay China, but this would result in them losing a very formidable and valuable friend. China's lack of violent intimidation towards other countries could be described as libertarian. In the future their behaviour may change, but so far they have become hugely influential around the world by much more humanistic methods than how the European/US empires were built.

    There are numerous common talking points that are made in the capitalist media when talking about the supposedly “authoritarian” nature of China. We often hear about the oppression of the Uighur and Tibetan people, as well as the religious sect Falun Gung. The alleged Tiananmen Square massacre is frequently referred to. In all cases, these allegations are provably false and slanderous. The suggestion that the People's Republic is committing cultural genocide against the Uighur people or locking them up in concentration camps is simply not true. In 2019  two coalitions sent competing letters to the UN Human Rights Council, one block condemning China's prisons in Xinjiang and another block showing support. Most of the countries condemning the prisons were western European countries, many with extensive histories of ruthless imperialism and colonialism, many who had committed genocide themselves numerous times. Most of the countries supporting China were Muslim majority countries, third world or socialist. The Palestinians, the worst oppressed nation of mostly Muslim people, approved of China's Uighur prison camps (ref #60). The truth is that it is about counteracting a very real terrorist threat and the prisons themselves are very humane and rehabilitative. The Communist Party practices very strong affirmative action. The government actively tries to lift up disadvantaged groups in society in order to raise everyone to the same level and give all Chinese people an equal opportunity in life. Some regions are more poor or less developed and need more assistance than others so the government gives them more support. This is communist philosophy in practice, it is an example of the principle, “from each according to their ability, to each according to their need”. For example minority groups like the Uighur and Tibetan people receive extra subsidies  for health, education, infrastructure and a variety of other reasons. Entrance scores for tertiary education are reduced and university substantially cheaper. Quotas are sometimes set for particular jobs where a certain number of disadvantaged minorities must be chosen (ref #61). The capitalist media often mentions Chinese oppression and organ harvesting from the Falun Gung religion. First of all, we must consider that the practice of transplanting organs from people who have recently died and assuming they consent unless they say otherwise, is relatively common. When you die, you no longer need the organs, you may as well use them to save somebody else's life. Many countries have this policy, including all of Scandinavia, France, Portugal, Greece, Austria, Belguim and many other places that are generally not regarded as being controlled by “authoritarian”, regimes. In 2017, China decided to ban this practice with regards to executed criminals due to concerns about this distorting the outcome of the judicial process (ref #62, ref #63). There are members of the Falung Gung group who are actual criminals and many of the religions' teachings are dangerous and harmful. They have prejudiced views towards homosexuals and interracial children. The leaders advise people not to take medicine. Falung Gung is also associated with a far right wing/fascist newspaper called the Epoch Times (ref #64, ref #65). With the Tiananmen square protests of 1989, there are strong reasons to believe that the story of the government massacring innocent protesters has been fabricated as anti-communist propaganda. There was certainly some violence, nobody really denies this. However, the communist party claim that a small minority of the protesters became violent, shooting at and throwing molotov cocktails at the People's liberation army, who then fired on the agressors in self defence. No photographic or video evidence shows who initiated the violence and therefore who was actually the aggressor. Deng Xiaoping's pro-capitalist reforms that began in 1978 were a valid cause for anxiety among the population. This was a new experimental strategy that could justifiably be viewed as compromising socialism to some extent. In hindsight, Xioaping's reforms have proven to be very successful, with strong net benefits for the Chinese population, however it was natural for people to be worried and a restoration of full capitalism. The western media has misrepresented the protests as being about demands for a western, bourgoise style of democracy while in reality, many were protesting because they were worried that their political system might become a capitalist type of democracy. Very drawn out negotiations between the government and protest leaders came to nothing and eventually the Party decided to send soldiers to move the protesters out of the square. No western journalists claim to have actually been present when the fighting started and there is no real basis for the positive assertion that there was a cold blooded massacre of innocent people (ref #66, ref #67). The capitalist media does some very extreme mental gymnastics in order to portray Socialist countries like China in a negative way.

    China has become a highly innovative, cutting edge country. They have created the most powerful quantum supercomputers by far, 1 million times faster than Google's quantum computer (ref #68, ref #69, ref #70). The People's Republic has constructed a quantum internet that can transmit information instantaneously, faster than the speed of light (ref #71, ref #72). They are building enormous construction projects, like a dam, entirely with robots (ref #73). China can build ten story buildings in 29 hours (ref #74). They have the world's largest super fast train network and the world's fastest trains (ref #75, ref #76). The People's Republic has constructed a 6g mobile network that is 10-20 times faster than 5g (ref #77). They also have the most powerful fusion reactors, they can maintain a reaction five times hotter than the sun for 17 minutes (ref #78, ref #79). China must be a very exciting place to live where people can really look forward to a brighter future.
    </p>
    <p>
    In conclusion, it is quite clear what China actually is. The People's Republic is a mostly socialist country that has made some relatively large concessions to the Bourgeoisie. These compromises have resulted in strong overall net benefits for the population, enormous improvements to the standard of living and quality of life. China is responsible for the most dramatic and rapid poverty alleviation in all of human history. 850 million Chinese people who used to be impoverished now have all their basic needs met. This prosperity has not resulted from imperialistic exploitation of workers in other countries. China has relatively libertarian, mutually beneficial relationships with foreign countries. They have created very strong economic growth in Africa and other Third World areas of the Earth. The Capitalist media of western countries has slandered China terribly precisely because of their enormous humanistic achievements. Hopefully, within the next few decades, China will overtake the United States of America as the dominant global superpower and this will be a very positive thing for working class people around the world.
