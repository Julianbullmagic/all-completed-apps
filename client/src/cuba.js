    <h1>Cuba</h1>
    <p>
    Thanks to the release of numerous formerly classified CIA documents, we now know the truth about Cuba. Most of the references for this article are directly from the website of the worst enemy of Socialism, the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States Government. There are many very rich and powerful people in this world who have strong motives for slandering Socialist countries like Cuba (especially Cuba) and hugely disproportionate access to mass mediums through which to spread these lies. The Communist Party of Cuba are radical humanists who have dramatically improved the quality of life of the the Cuban people. The government have taken large steps towards guaranteeing that all Cubans will have their basic needs met, massively reducing poverty and guaranteeing the necessities of life are affordable and in many cases provided for free at public expense. Housing, public transport, electricity, university, childcare and many other essential services are either free or cheap. The Communist party have greatly improved that status of African people and women, eliminating the worst aspects of racism and sexism. The standards of health and education are the best in the third world and in many ways as good or better than some first world countries. The Party created a much more fair and equitable distribution of wealth than Capitalist countries. Their private sector is largely worker-cooperatives, 30% of their GDP is produced by democratic businesses where the workers are the shareholders and the public sector is somewhat like an enormous co-operative in which all Cubans are a member and the goal is to meet human needs instead of generate profits. Their society is highly unionised with the vast majority of their people in at least one union and most work arrangements negotiated through unions. Recently, the sustainable development index found Cuba to be the most sustainable country in the world.

    When you look through the references for this essay, you may find it strange to see the worst enemies of Socialism admitting very blatantly that socialism leads to superior economic performance for ordinary people. This is because the Capitalist ruling class have quite a fundamentally different point of view. Their lives are largely insulated from the consequences of their actions. They mostly spend time with other elites who think in a similar way and they reinforce each others ideology and belief in their own superiority to ordinary people. In many cases they genuinely believe that capitalism is actually meritocratic and that their own merciless sociopath behaviour makes them superior to normal people. They simply do not see wage growth, low unemployment rates and dramatic improvements to the standards of health as a good thing. As long as there is economic growth and rich people are getting richer, then the economy is going great from their point of view. They simply do not see high rates of homelessness and poverty as something shameful that reflect poorly on their leadership. Therefore, most of the statistical evidence that demonstrates the huge social problems with capitalism comes directly from the statistics bureaus of the capitalist governments themselves.

     The Cuban Communist Party have created a much more humanistic economic system that is aimed at meeting the needs of population instead of generating profits for a ruling elite. The distribution of wealth is also more equitable than most capitalist countries. For most of the history of Cuba, the average income of Cubans has tended to increase, although there was a very sharp drop in the early 1990s with the collapse of the Soviet Union, their biggest trading partner and main source of fossil fuels (ref#1). The communist party created a much more egalitarian and equitable distribution of income. They probably have the lowest economic inequality in the world. They also banned passive unearned incomes from rents, dividends, interest on loans or royalties. (ref#2) Unemployment rates were dramatically reduced, making it much easier to find a job and to change job (ref#3). Numerous crowd sourcing cost of living websites show that the cost of living is relatively cheap in Cuba (ref#4,ref#5,ref#6,ref#7). This is data gathered by capitalist businesses, it is not Communist government propaganda. Their economic planning system largely shelters the population from the inflation experienced by other countries in Latin America. Rationing and subsidies result in fairly steady prices for food and consumer goods. The government provides many subsidies, such as for rents, public utilities, public transport and medical services. All the basic necessities of life are affordable to all Cubans (ref#8). Cuba has an unusually high rate of home-ownership and close to zero homeless people (ref #9,ref #10,ref#11)


    The revolution has brought enormous improvements to Cuba's education system. A large-scale public education program has effectively eliminated illiteracy and has significantly upgraded Cuban educational levels. The islands educational indicators are among the best in the third world, literacy rate has risen to about 96 percent the highest in Latin America and one of the highest in the world. (ref#12). Cuba has universal free education(ref#13).

    Cuban socialism has resulted in enormous improvements to the status of women. In few other country are men and women treated more equally than in Cuba. The communist party made strong efforts to reduce sexual discrimination and initiated policies to facilitate the entry of women into the workforce. They created subsidised day care centres to provide affordable childcare. In 1953 women were 17% of total work force, by 1975 this figure had risen to 28%. By 1980 more than 40 percent of the labour union leadership is female. (ref #14) In 2021, 53% of representatives in the Cuban National Parliament were women (ref #15). Since the Cuban communist party transformed the Island, the status of African people has enormously improved. Black people no longer encounter blatant discrimination in the juridical process. Organisations limiting their membership or their activities to a particular ethnic or racial group are illegal (ref #16, ref #17).

    Cuba has a very high quality free universal healthcare system, the standards of health have improved enormously since the revolution. Their doctors have eradicated or almost eradicated diseases like polio, diphtheria, malaria and nutritional deficiencies. The rates of teenage pregnancy and infant mortality are unusually low, even when compared to developed countries. By 1980 life expectancy had been raised to 72 years, the highest in Latin America and comparable to many first world countries. Dietary improvement through guaranteed access to basic foodstuffs also has been a  major factor in combating nutritional deficiencies and an increasing resistance to disease (ref #18). Life expectancy is now 79 years. (ref #19).

    Cuba is a genuinely internationalist country. Nothing about the way they interact with other countries can be described as even somewhat imperialistic. They do try to form mutually beneficial relationships with other countries. They host students from all around the world, 75 different third world countries. They set up schools in developing countries to provide cheap or free education. The socialist country also provides workers usually to little or no charge, they send doctors, construction workers, agricultural scientists and many other kinds of assistance that help alleviate third world problems. The cumulative value of this assistance amounts to about $400 million USD (ref #20). Cuba does not export capital in order to exploit poorer weaker countries like European Oligarchs have done for hundreds of years.

    The revolutionary Island of Cuba has one of the most humane criminal justice systems in the world, their focus is largely on rehabilitating criminals, giving them an opportunity to rebuild their lives. Incarcerated criminals are expected to study an acquire some sort of qualification if they don't have one already, this education is provided for free by the state. Inmates who are not studying are expected to work and they are paid the same amount for their labour as they would outside prison. One third is set aside to maintain the prison, pay the staff, guards, cleaners, cooks etc. They can keep the rest for themselves unless they are have any dependent who they must support. In this case, another fraction of their income is sent to the family. The rate of incarceration in Cuba is 190 per 100,000, in Australia, this figure is 214 per 100,000. (ref #21,ref #22). Professional Judges are always make their decisions with elected lay judges. The lay judges always outnumber the professional, 2 for 1 at lower level courts and 3 for 2 at higher level courts. This helps to ensure that professional judges have a genuine authority, grounded in knowledge, wisdom an moral integrity. The ability of the lay judges to overrule the professional ones means that there is greater pressure on professional judges to demonstrate their own legitimacy. They cannot make any judgement without persuading and convincing the lay judges. In capitalist countries, legal fees are usually extremely expensive, in Cuba, all lawyers are public workers, and their fees are quite heavily subsidised to make them affordable to all Cubans, not just the rich. It also is not possible to settle out of court, rich criminals cannot bribe their victims in order to escape punishment like they can in the United States (ref #21).

     The capitalist media and capitalist academic literature generally describe Cuba's political system as highly coercive, authoritarian and tyrannical, as though the people living on the Island are too stupid to understand that their government has enormously improved their lives and the population just refuse to cooperate with this assistance. This is obviously ridiculous, the people are very supportive of the Cuban Communist Party and extremely proud of their own socialist achievements.  In our highly complicated modern world, some sort of representative democracy is needed. We must elect experts to make decisions about certain issues. Of course, a very direct sort of democracy like the one practised in Ancient Athens is inappropriate for advanced industrial societies. In Athens there was just a huge assembly that all citizens could attend and anyone can be involved in making decisions about anything. Today, democracy means electing a government that substantially fights to improve the lives of the population as much as possible. A government that actually shows leadership, tries to plan the economy in a rational way in order to meet the needs of the people, reduce exploitation and corruption as much as possible. A democratic government will try their best to consult and discuss with the population to try to reach collective decisions that most people are happy with, but also ones that are well informed with expert advice. If a question is relevant to you, or you have the expertise to understand it, then you should be directly involved in making that choice. By these criteria the Cuban Communist Party are probably the most democratic government in the world. They have actively and strongly encouraged the population to participate in the political life of the country. Propaganda campaigns were used to  encourage everyone to join and participate in at least one mass organisation or union (ref #23). In 2008, 81.4% of Cubans were members of unions (ref #24). The Cuban constitution was created in quite a unique way, through a process of heavy direct public consultation and debate involving the majority of the population and national referendum. No other country has had their entire constitution approved with a referendum and very few achieve such high rates of voter turnout and approval. Their two constitutional referendum, 1976 and 2019, both achieved above 85% voter turnout and 85% approval. The 1976 referendum had 98% voter turnout and 99% approval. Voting is voluntary in Cuba with no punishment or fine for abstaining (ref #25,ref #26,#27). This figures might seem too good to be true if you did not understand how enormously the Cuban government has improved the lives of the population. An integral aspect of Cuban self government are the Committees for the Defence of the revolution. A holistic system of direct democratic participation. Participation is completely voluntary, however the vast majority of people do join these collectives. This organisation has a range of functions, providing community services, performing a neighbourhood watch patrol, providing rehabilitation, mental health services and financial support for misdemeanour offenders. (ref #28,ref #29). Besides mobilizing society for the defense of the revolution and the triumph of socialism, the CDRs also had a role in national literacy and vaccination campaigns. They maintain social hygiene by eradicating the origins of transmission for certain diseases. They popularly mobilized people for demonstrations for Elian Gonzalez, the “Five Heroes” spies, or Mariel Boatlift. The CDR is also vital for the National Civil Defense as they evacuate millions of people during hurricanes and are responsible for block clean up operations to remove debris and clear up roads, among others. CDR has additional responsibilities beyond monitoring individual's political and moral background; these include arranging community festivals, administrating voluntary community projects, and organising community attendance to mass rallies. Proponents further emphasise that CDRs have helped to put medical, educational, or other campaigns into national effect. They also act as centres for many who do not work in farms or factories, and hence include a large proportion of female membership. The CDRs also take an active role in vaccination campaigns, blood banks, recycling, practicing evacuations for hurricanes, and supporting the government in its fight against corruption (ref #29). Since the 1990s, Cuba has expanded their private sector, today about 29% of people are either self-employed or work for a co-operative enterprise. In co-operatives, the workers are the shareholders, they own the business, decide how profit is distributed, how much to pay to themselves and how much to reinvest. They can also elected their own managers and directors (ref #30). The Public sector is still very large, 72% of people work for public enterprises. At times, independent private firms do contracts for the government, leading to some ambiguity about how to classify them (ref #31). The public sector could be considered as an enormous co-operative that all Cubans are a member of, except it's purpose is not to make profit, but rather to meet the needs of the population and promote equality.

    Cuba can be described as a semi-direct democracy that tries to incorporate the best aspects of both representative and direct democracy. They have created a political system that achieves a nice balance between democracy and technocracy, in other words, they reach decisions that are well informed with expert advice, but also ones that most people are happy with. Political lobbying is banned and money has little influence over the selection of their election process. All potential candidates have equal access to the state media with which to explain their credentials to the population. Their election procedure has been widely misrepresented in the Capitalist Media and Capitalist academic literature. Candidates are chosen in local direct assemblies that anyone can participate in. There are public debates and conversations about who is most suitable for leadership, each nominee submits their resume and people discuss who is most qualified, who has the best track record of improving the lives of the people they represent. After candidates are chosen, there is an election in which people can approve and disapprove of the candidate they have already chosen. If the candidate receives less than 50% approval, then another candidate is chosen and people can vote in a second round of elections. This almost never happens because the people have already chosen the candidate at their local assembly and the election is just to give a stamp of approval. This is a much more genuinely meritocratic way of choosing leaders than Capitalist election procedures. Cuba can be more accurately described as a no-party state than a one party state as candidates are chosen directly by the people and are not appointed by the Cuban Communist Party. The Communist Party mainly just has moral and intellectual authority and not power (ref #32, ref #33).

    Cuban socialism also recognises that the well-being of the human race is inextricably linked with the well-being of planet Earth. Cubans are highly environmentally progressive. In 2015 they were found to be the most sustainably developed country in the world by the Sustainable Development Index (ref #34). Most of the Island's food is produced by permaculture techniques in agricultural co-operatives. Cuban agricultural scientists are also pioneers in the field of organic farming, creating many of their own innovative techniques to increase yields sustainably (ref #35,ref #36).

    The only authoritarian regime trying to tyrannise Cuba is the United States oligarchy. The achievements of the Cuban revolution are embarrassing to these elites. The United States is the richest country in the world but still there are half a million people living on the streets while Cuba has close to zero. Monopolistic pharmaceutical companies extort vast sums of money from people in exchange for vital medicines they need to live and encourage doctors to over prescribe highly addictive opiates and psycho-stimulants. The United States has an very token kind of democracy, statistical analysis has demonstrated that the views of ordinary US citizens have close to zero impact on decisions made by the government (ref #37), rates of union membership are vastly lower than Cuba (only 10%)(ref #38), the co-operative and public sectors are vastly smaller (ref #39,ref#40). Real wage growth in the States has stagnated since the 1980s (ref #41). The USA one of the most economically unequal countries in the world, while Cuba is one of the most equitable (ref #42). The CIA tried and failed to assassinate the leader of Cuba, Fidel Castro 638 times (ref #43, ref #44). They have made numerous attempts to sabotage and destroy Cuba's socialism, one notable example was Operation Mongoose (ref #45). Since relatively soon after the Cuban revolution, the United States has blockaded Cuba's economy with the explicit goal of starving and impoverishing the entire population of the country. This is obviously an extremely sadistic and completely disproportionate punishment (ref #46). In 2010, a secret diplomatic cable from the United States Government, obtained and released by wikileaks revealed that political dissidents have little support in Cuba. (ref #47).

    Supposed Human Rights NGOs like Amnesty International and Human Rights watch frequently slander Cuba, accusing them of human rights abuses. It is quite clear that these are deeply corrupt organisations, accepting enormous bribes (they call them “grants”) from ruthless imperialistic capitalist governments and billionaires. Amnesty claims on their website that they do not accept money from governments so that they can stay independent of political ideology, but this is a blatant lie, you can see in the accounts they publish on their own website that they clearly have taken many millions of dollars in bribes from the US, UK, Israeli, French and many other governments. Human Rights Watch's biggest donor is the billionaire George Soros (ref #48, ref #49, ref #50).

    In conclusion, there is a very extensive number of United States government documents that prove quite conclusively what Cuba actually is. The Socialist island is a beacon of hope for working class people around the world. Cuba represents a possible world without imperialism, exploitation, oppression, domination or bullying of any kind. Cuba has demonstrated that this is a practical and viable reality and not a utopian fantasy. They pose an immense threat to the socio-pathic oligarchs who rule planet Earth. They have slandered Cuba terribly because they don't want us to know that their own authority is completely illegitimate. They are nothing but a burden on us and they take vastly more than they give.
