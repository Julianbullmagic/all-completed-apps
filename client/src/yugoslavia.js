    <h1>Yugoslavia</h1>
    <p>
The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) was a very encouraging experiment in Socialism that existed from 1945 to 1992. As with most other Communist countries, the CIA archives provide us with an abundance of valuable sources that tell a very clear story, one of massive improvements to the quality of life of the population. There were enormous gains in health, education, political participation, real wage growth and social equality. Yugoslavia had a very distinctive “self-management” system. This was much more decentralised than the Soviet Union, giving much more power to individual organisations, each of which was controlled by an elected worker council. Yugoslavia also experienced some economic difficulties that the USSR did not, inflation, higher unemployment and economic cycles. On the whole, despite it's faults, this Balkan Socialist country set a very promising example of what a world without exploitation, domination and imperialism could look like.    </p>
    <p>
    On the whole, socialism in Yugoslavia resulted in a substantially more humanistic economic system that was better at meeting the needs of the population and improving their quality of life more rapidly than capitalism. Gross National Product tripled between the between the foundation of The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1945) and 1973. This growth was targeted at improving the general standard of living of the population, with enormous improvements to the quality of education, healthcare, social equality, social security and political equality. While Yugoslavia did have persistent problems with infaltion, gdp growth, as well as gdp per capita growth tended to outpace this rise in prices (ref #1,ref #2,ref #3,ref#4). Living levels in both the rural and urban areas improved markedly between 1950 and 1973 and became considerably higher than pre-World War Two Yugoslavia. Peasants in even the poorest parts of the country were drawn into the money economy and had cash at their disposal for the purchase of clothing, furniture and consumer durables which traditionally had been a rarity in most peasant households. The variety and quality of goods available to the Yugoslav consumer compared favourably with other Eastern European countries and prices were generally lower relative to wages than elsewhere in Eastern Europe. In many instances, however, an apartment was included with the workers job at a nominal rent. Economic inequality became dramatically reduced, the earnings ratio between persons with university-level training and the unskilled workers was roughly 3:1 (ref #5). The government practised affirmative action, they actively channelled funds into less developed regions in order to narrow the gap between developed and underdeveloped parts of the federation(ref #6).

Yugoslavia had very extensive political democracy. They attempted to create a new kind of representative democracy much more suited to a modern, industrial, scientifically and technologically advanced society. Of course, our modern world is extremely complicated and it is necessary to somehow elect experts to make decisions about certain questions. Yugoslavia attempted to create a nice balance between democracy and technocracy, decisions that most people are happy with, but also that are well informed with expert knowledge. It was not a direct democracy in the sense the Ancient Athens was a direct democracy, with a large assembly that anyone can attend and anyone can vote in and make proposals. Instead, power was still quite evenly spread out so that people could be involved in making decisions about things that were relevant to them (ref #7). Almost all organisations had an elected council, all enterprises had an elected worker-council, rates of union membership were very high. Public participation in government had grown hugely. I particular important organ of popular political involvement was The Socialist Alliance of Working People of Yugoslavia, which became a forum in which the voice of the people could be heard. Meetings were used as the forum for open debates on constitutional amendments and the organisation's concomitant drive to strengthen ties with socialist parties in the west (ref #8). Extremely significant was the flexibility the Yugoslavs showed in introducing their reforms. This indicated a genuine willingness on the part of the government to listen to domestic criticisms and to meet objections if they appear valid, constitutional amendments were often substantially altered in response to this criticism (ref #9). Workers became increasingly articulate, and strikes, or work stoppages as they were euphemistically called, became a highly effective means of gaining demands (ref#10). Yugoslavia's university students even became involved in the governance of their own academic institutions, in 1970 students in Zagreb succeeded in defeating a candidate for school pro rector who had been approved by the communist party (ref #11). In 1969 Serbia amended their university law to allow faculty and students a free hand in the election of their deans and rectors (ref #12). The self-management system was eventually introduced into virtually all elements of Yugoslav society. Even prisoners are encouraged to form councils in order to increase their production and to prepare themselves better to fit into a self-managed society when they would be released (ref #13). Self management had many strengths, however it also seemed to create problems with inflation, an ongoing, chronic economic problem for Yugoslavia, many enterprise councils, in the absence of competitors, would raised prices in order to increase wages (ref #14). Self management was even applied to the judicial system. Every citizen who was of age could be elected a judge or judge-juror. Judges and judge-jurors are elected or dismissed by the people's executive councils and the people's assemblies. Judges and judge-jurors make their judgements together, the jurors always outnumber the professional judges and can outvote them. This helps to ensure the moral authority of judge is legitimate, they must demonstrate their trustworthiness and moral integrity in order to make judgements (ref #15).

This increased of political democracy, combined with the leadership of the Communist Party, resulted in very generous social security system. They made great progress towards guaranteeing all Yugoslav people would have their basic needs met. Between 1945 and the 1970s, the states social security budget increased 600%(ref #16). The government introduced extensive subsidies for public health care, temporary disability and illness, old age pensions and assistance to mothers. In particular, there were a great number of social security benefits intended to take the pressure of child raising off women, making it easier for them to study at technical colleges or universities and gain employment. Women received 90 days paid maternity leave after having a baby, a range of other subsidies to help pay for food, clothing and other necessities. There were also subsidised public childcare services that low income families could use for free (ref #17). Like most other Socialist revolutions, there was an enormous improvement to the status of women. Disabled workers were entitled to another corresponding job and received a disability pension if they needed to train in a new career (ref #18,ref #19). Pensions were also given to family members of disabled people if a physician said their support was required (ref #20, ref#21. The education system dramatically improved and extended to all citizens. Before the revolution, the population had been largely illiterate and uneducated, Communism brought an end to this (ref #22, ref #23, ref #24).
    </p>

    Communism brought enormous improvements to the standards of health in Yugoslavia. The rate of death declined from 12.7 per 1000 in 1947 to 8.7 per 1000 in 1968. Infant mortality dropped from 116 per 1000 in 1953 to 59.8 per 1000 for males and 54.3 per 1000 for females. Hospital services expanded hugely, there was 1 hospital bed per 180 Yugoslav people (ref #25). Medical students could study for free and received a stipend to cover their living expenses. Textbooks were also provided for free. Yugoslavia experienced a levelling of educational opportunities, people of all economic levels could study what they were wanted without discrimination(ref #26).

    By now it should be clear that the label “authoritarian” simply just doesn't apply to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The party possessed a genuine kind of authority, the authority of knowledge, wisdom, humility and moral integrity. In the beginning, it may have been necessary for them to use power in order to effect the transition to socialism, but this gradually faded as the people's new found economic security and political participation made them increasingly self confident. The Communist party may have had valuable knowledge about what a fair and democratic society should look like, but they, like all leaders, were just human beings, capable of making mistakes. The masses were willing and able to overrule the party if necessary and there are many examples of them doing this. Capitalist constitutions often have token checks and balances written into them they are designed to give the appearance of democracy and accountability, without actually providing real democracy. For example, the United States constitution supposedly has an impeachment process to allow the president to be removed from office but it has never actually been used. Some capitalist systems, like California or Switzerland, have a procedure that allows citizens to initiate referenda by collecting petitions of a certain size but in neither case does this actually promote democracy. These two places are not at all socialist, neither have public healthcare, rates of homelessness are high, there is practically no democracy within most enterprises, economic inequality is huge etc. This was not so in Yugoslavia, there were many examples of people genuinely holding their government accountable and forcing them to concede when criticised. For example, in the 1967 election, people were heavily involved in selecting candidates in public gatherings. Voter turnout was very high, 89% of people participated and 30% of communist party backed candidates failed to win. In order to prevent anyone from getting too comfortable in a position of power there were frequent rotations in office, mainly in the elective posts, to foster the infusion of new blood into the political system. This helped to counter bureaucratism, routininsm and dogmatism. The role of president rotated annually (ref #27).

Yugoslavia's economic system was distinctly less centralised than the Soviet Union. There was a relatively large independent private sector that consisted mostly of cooperatives. Workers councils in factories were elected by the workers. The council then elected management boards to manage the factories in conjunction with the factory directors. Workers could dismiss the board, councils adopted wage regulations, formulated operating plans for the factory and distributed part of the profit of the factory (ref #28). Cooperatives were organised on the principle of voluntary efforts and internal democracy. All members of a cooperative were equal, with equal rights and equal duties. In the countryside, agricultural co-operatives were more than just businesses, they also aimed to raise economic and cultural levels and to develop socialism in villages. In addition to developing agricultural production, they dealt with village communal problems, such as electrification, health and veterinary stations, water supply and construction of cooperative centres. They also contributed to the technical, cultural, educational, ideological and political advancement of villages (ref #29). It was unnecessary to force farmers to join these agricultural cooperatives, instead the party persuaded them by demonstrating the benefits such as higher yeilds and by providing financial 2incentives. Loans at 1% p/a interest were given to help start these democratic businesses. This money was given by public banks, the interest was used to fund Yugoslavia's generous social security system. The government also created a range of different types of cooperative of varying levels of socialism/collectivism. Some with more sharing of land, machines and resources and more political participation than others. The idea was to gradually wean workers onto collectivism. They did not necessarily need to invest hugely as they might have perceived this as risky because socialism was new and unfamiliar. Instead, workers could invest a little bit, see some benefits, and then invest increasingly more and more if they felt comfortable. For example, farmers did not necessarily have to sell their land and machines to a cooperative, they could just rent them. This proved to be a highly effective collectivisation process, membership in agricultural cooperatives increased from half a million people in 1945 to 3.5 million in 1950 (ref #30, ref #31).

To me, it seems unclear overall whether the Soviet Union's version of Socialism was superior to that of Yugoslavia, they each had their own strengths and weaknesses. Yugoslavia had substantially more political democracy, while the USSR had better overall economic performance. Collectivisation in Yugoslavia was less forceful than the Soviet Union, however it was also much less rapid. It doesn't seem fair to judge one as better than the other. The circumstances in which they both were born were very different. If you read the writings of the Bolshevik leaders, there is a clear understanding that persuasion is superior to coercion because people work with much more enthusiasm if they have been persuaded to do something than if they have been forced. There are even CIA documents were they admit that this is how the Russian Communist Party thought (ref #32). In this respect, the ideology of the Bolsheviks and the Yugoslav communist party was essentially the same.  Their differing circumstances were the reason for their different approaches to collectivisation. All governments become more authoritarian during times of crisis. Soviet Russia was born  into terrible crisis, a horrible civil war, then several capitalist countries tried to invade and destroy them, then soon after they needed to prepare for WW2. They also had no other socialist countries to support them and they had to figure out how to do socialism on their own. The learning curve was steep. Dire circumstances call for stronger leadership. If they had not industrialised and collectivised at break-neck speed, Socialist Russia would not have been strong enough to survive World War Two. We know this because Bolshevism co-existed with numerous other socialist ideologies, some much more libertarian. None of the other varieties produced a viable lasting form of socialism that could substantially improve people's lives. For example, there was an libertarian/anarchist socialist revolution in Spain in the 1930s that was quickly crushed by the Fascist government. Yugoslavia was born into a world where the threat of Fascism in Europe had been largely suppressed at least for the time being. While there may have been some initial ideological disagreements between the Russian and Yugoslav communist parties, they did eventually provide mutual aid and support to each other.

I feel that if Yugoslavia had been allowed to continue, they probably would have eventually learned how to resolve their economic difficulties. It certainly was a very admirable and encouraging socialist experiment that greatly improved the lives of many millions of people.
