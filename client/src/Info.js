      <h3>Cuba</h3>
      <p>Thanks to the release of numerous formerly classified CIA documents, we now know the truth about Cuba. Most of the references for this article are directly from the website of the worst enemy of Socialism, the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States Government. There are many very rich and powerful people in this world who have strong motives for slandering Socialist countries like Cuba (especially Cuba) and hugely disproportionate access to mass mediums through which to spread these lies. The Communist Party of Cuba are radical humanists who have dramatically improved the quality of life of the the Cuban people. The government have taken large steps towards guaranteeing that all Cubans will have their basic needs met, massively reducing poverty and guaranteeing the necessities of life are affordable and in many cases provided for free at public expense. Housing, public transport, electricity, university, childcare and many other essential services are either free or cheap. The Communist party have greatly improved that status of African people and women, eliminating the worst aspects of racism and sexism. The standards of health and education are the best in the third world and in many ways as good or better than some first world countries. The Party created a much more fair and equitable distribution of wealth than Capitalist countries. Their private sector is largely worker-cooperatives, 30% of their GDP is produced by democratic businesses where the workers are the shareholders and the public sector is somewhat like an enormous co-operative in which all Cubans are a member and the goal is to meet human needs instead of generate profits. Their society is highly unionised with the vast majority of their people in at least one union and most work arrangements negotiated through unions. Recently, the sustainable development index found Cuba to be the most sustainable country in the world. </p>
