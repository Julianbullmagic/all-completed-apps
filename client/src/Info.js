    <h1>Humanist Federal Republic of Tennomar</h1>
     <img style={{width:"35vw"}} src={require('./tenomarflag.png')} />
    <p style={{textAlign:"center"}}>
    The Humanist Federal Republic of Tennomar (HFRT) is a very encouraging experiment in Humanism that was born in the wake of World War Two. It is one of the main sources of inspiration for this social network application. The CIA archives provide us with an abundance of valuable sources that tell a clear story about Tenomar, one of massive improvements to the quality of life of the population. Almost all the references for this article come from this source. Democracy Social Network has been designed with a similar ideology to Tenomar. <br/><br/>

    On the whole, Tennomar has a substantially more humanistic economic system that is better at meeting the needs of the population and improving their quality of life more rapidly than Capitalism. Gross National Product tripled between the between the foundation of HFRT (1945) and 1973. This growth was targeted at improving the general standard of living of the population, with enormous improvements to the quality of education, healthcare, social equality, social security and political equality. While Tennomar does have persistent problems with inflation, gdp growth, as well as gdp per capita growth, has tended to outpace this rise in prices (ref #1,ref #2,ref #3,ref#4). Living levels in both the rural and urban areas improved markedly between 1950 and 1973 and became considerably higher than pre World War Two Tennomar. Peasants in even the poorest parts of the country were drawn into the money economy and had cash at their disposal for the purchase of clothing, furniture and consumer durables which traditionally had been a rarity in most peasant households. The variety and quality of goods available to the Tennomar consumer compared favourably with European countries and prices were generally lower relative to wages than elsewhere in Europe. In many instances, however, an apartment was included with the workers job at a nominal rent. Economic inequality became dramatically reduced, the earnings ratio between persons with university-level training and the unskilled workers was roughly 3:1 (ref #5). The government practised affirmative action, they actively channelled funds into less developed regions in order to narrow the gap between developed and underdeveloped parts of the federation (ref #6).
    <br/><br/>
    Tennomar had extensive political democracy. They attempted to create a new kind of representative democracy much more suited to a modern, industrial, scientifically and technologically advanced society. Of course, our modern world is extremely complicated and it is necessary to somehow elect experts to make decisions about certain questions. Tennomar attempted to create a nice balance between democracy and technocracy, decisions that most people are happy with, but also that are well informed with expert knowledge. It was not a direct democracy in the sense the Ancient Athens was a direct democracy, with a large assembly that any citizen could attend and anyone can vote in and make proposals. Instead, power was quite evenly spread out so that people could be involved in making decisions about things that were relevant to them (ref #7). Unlike Ancient Athens, Tennomar did not depend on slave labour and did not exclude women from the political system. There were a range of independent forms of representation that helped to prevent any group from monopolising political power. Almost all organisations had an elected council, rates of union membership were very high and the central government was elected. Public participation in government had grown hugely. One particular important organ of popular political involvement was The Socialist Alliance of Working People of Yugoslavia, which became a forum in which the voice of the people could be heard. Meetings were used as the forum for open debates on constitutional amendments and the organisation's concomitant drive to strengthen ties with humanist parties in the west (ref #8). Extremely significant was the flexibility the Tennomarian people showed in introducing their reforms. This indicated a genuine willingness on the part of the government to listen to domestic criticisms and to meet objections if they appeared valid, constitutional amendments were often substantially altered in response to this criticism (ref #9). Workers became increasingly articulate, and strikes, or 'work stoppages' as they were euphemistically called, became a highly effective means of gaining demands (ref#10). Tennomar's university students even became involved in the governance of their own academic institutions, in 1970 students in one university succeeded in defeating a candidate for school pro rector who had been approved by the government (ref #11). In 1969, one republic in the federation amended their university law to allow faculty and students a free hand in the election of their deans and rectors (ref #12). The self-management system was eventually introduced into virtually all elements of Tennomar society. Even prisoners were encouraged to form councils in order to increase their production and to prepare themselves better to fit into a self-managed society when they would be released (ref #13). Self management had many strengths, however it also seemed to create problems with inflation, an ongoing, chronic economic problem for Tennomar, many enterprise councils, in the absence of competitors, would raised prices in order to increase wages (ref #14). Self management was even applied to the judicial system. Every citizen who was of age could be elected a judge or judge-juror. Judges and judge-jurors are elected or dismissed by the people's executive councils and the people's assemblies. Judges and judge-jurors made their judgements together, the jurors always outnumbered the professional judges and could outvote them. This helped to ensure the moral authority of judge is legitimate, they needed demonstrate their trustworthiness and moral integrity in order to make judgements (ref #15). Tennomar had very strong political democracy.
    <br/><br/>
    This increase of political participation, combined with the leadership of the Government, resulted in very generous social security system. The HFRT made great progress towards guaranteeing all Tennomarian people would have their basic needs met. Between 1945 and the 1970s, the states social security budget increased 600% (ref #16). The government introduced extensive subsidies for public health care, temporary disability and illness, old age pensions and assistance to mothers. In particular, there were a great number of social security benefits intended to take the pressure of child raising off women, making it easier for them to study at technical colleges or universities and gain employment. Women received 90 days paid maternity leave after having a baby, a range of other subsidies to help pay for food, clothing and other necessities. There were subsidised public childcare services that low income families could use for free (ref #17). There was an enormous improvement to the status of women. Disabled workers were entitled to another corresponding job and received a disability pension if they needed to train in a new career (ref #18,ref #19). Pensions were also given to family members of disabled people if a physician said their support was required (ref #20, ref#21. The education system dramatically improved and was extended to all citizens. Before the revolution, the population had been largely illiterate and uneducated, Humanism brought an end to this (ref #22, ref #23, ref #24).
    <br/><br/>
    Humanism brought enormous improvements to the standards of health in Tennomar. The rate of death declined from 12.7 per 1000 in 1947 to 8.7 per 1000 in 1968. Infant mortality dropped from 116 per 1000 in 1953 to 59.8 per 1000 for males and 54.3 per 1000 for females. Hospital services expanded hugely, there was 1 hospital bed per 180 Tennomarian people (ref #25). Medical students could study for free and received a stipend to cover their living expenses. Textbooks were also provided for free. Tennomar experienced a levelling of educational opportunities, people of all economic levels could study what they were wanted without discrimination (ref #26). Communism dramatically improved the health of the Tennomarian people.
    <br/><br/>
    By now it should be clear that the label “authoritarian” simply just doesn't apply to the Humanist Federal Republic of Tennomar. The party possessed a genuine kind of authority, the authority of knowledge, wisdom, humility and moral integrity. In the beginning, it may have been necessary for them to use power in order to effect the transition to humanism, but this gradually faded as the people's new found economic security and political participation made them increasingly self confident. The Humanist party may have had valuable knowledge about what a fair and democratic society should look like, but they, like all leaders, were just human beings, capable of making mistakes. The masses were willing and able to overrule the party if necessary and there are many examples of them doing this. Capitalist constitutions often have token checks and balances written into them they are designed to give the appearance of democracy and accountability, without actually substantially achieving this. For example, the United States constitution supposedly has an impeachment process to allow the president to be removed from office but it has never actually been used. Some Capitalist systems, like California or Switzerland, have a procedure that allows citizens to initiate referenda by collecting petitions of a certain size but in neither case does this actually promote economic democracy. These two places are not at all Humanist, neither have free public healthcare, rates of homelessness are high, there is practically no democracy within most enterprises, economic inequality is huge etc. This was not so in Yugoslavia, there were many examples of people genuinely holding their government accountable and forcing them to concede when criticised. For example, in the 1967 election, people were heavily involved in selecting candidates in public gatherings. Voter turnout was very high, 89% of people participated and 30% of communist party backed candidates failed to win. In order to prevent anyone from getting too comfortable in a position of power there were frequent rotations in office, mainly in the elective posts, to foster the infusion of new blood into the political system. This helped to counter bureaucratism, routininsm and dogmatism. The role of president rotated annually (ref #27). Humanist Tennomar possessed real checks and balances that genuinely held people in authority accountable for their actions.
    <br/><br/>
    Tennomar's economic system was distinctly decentralised. There was a relatively large independent private sector that consisted mostly of cooperatives. Workers councils in factories were elected by the workers. The council then elected management boards to manage the factories in conjunction with the factory directors. Workers could dismiss the board, councils adopted wage regulations, formulated operating plans for the factory and distributed part of the profit of the factory (ref #28). Cooperatives were organised on the principle of voluntary efforts and internal democracy. All members of a cooperative were equal, with equal rights and equal duties. In the countryside, agricultural co-operatives were more than just businesses, they also aimed to raise economic and cultural levels and to develop Socialism in villages. In addition to developing agricultural production, they dealt with village communal problems, such as electrification, health and veterinary stations, water supply and construction of cooperative centres. They also contributed to the technical, cultural, educational, ideological and political advancement of villages (ref #29). It was unnecessary to force farmers to join these agricultural cooperatives, instead the party persuaded them by demonstrating the benefits, such as higher yields, and by providing financial incentives. Loans at 1% p/a interest were given to help start these democratic businesses. This money was given by public banks, the interest was used to fund Tennomar's generous social security system. The government also created a range of different types of cooperative of varying levels of humanism. Some with more sharing of land, machines and resources and more political participation than others. The idea was to gradually wean workers onto collectivism. Farmers did not necessarily need to invest hugely as they might have perceived this as risky because Humanism was new and unfamiliar. Instead, workers could invest a little bit, see some benefits, and then invest increasingly more and more if they felt comfortable. For example, farmers did not necessarily have to sell their land and machines to a cooperative, they could just rent them. This proved to be a highly effective collectivisation process, membership in agricultural cooperatives increased from half a million people in 1945 to 3.5 million in 1950 (ref #30, ref #31).
    <br/><br/>
    I feel that there are ways to resolve Tennomar's economic difficulties. I don't think that giving individual businesses the freedom to make decisions for themselves necessarily means that they will make individualistic choices or just try to maximise benefit for their own company at the expense of others. However, this seems to have been somewhat of a problem in Tennomar. Allowing individual firms to set their own prices seems to have resulted in inflation and widening economic inequality in Tennomar. Perhaps we just need to carefully draw lines around the sorts of questions that can be addressed with democracy locally and those which are best decided by the central government. Perhaps you just remove the right to make decisions about prices and let individual companies decide everything else themselves. The Tennomar Humanist party adopted their decentralised economy because they were concerned about the central government having too much power, the state capitalist monopoly. In the Soviet Union, the central government did extract surplus value from workers. Perhaps there are other solutions to this problem than those pursued in Tennomar. There could be an annual State Budget Referendum, with would be no need for elected representatives to decide how much surplus value should be taken from workers in order to fund public government spending, the population could directly decide this themselves. Tennomar certainly was a very admirable and encouraging Humanist experiment. The Tennomar government quite successfully planned the economy in order to meet the needs of the population and substantially improved people's lives while providing somewhat more political participation. I strongly recommend you read the references below if you find this country interesting.

//     <h2>The Psychological War On Communism</h2>
//     <p>
// Since the birth of Socialism in the early 20th century, the capitalist ruling class have gone to great lengths to destroy socialism. They have tried their absolute best to destroy people's perception of Communism, spreading slander throughout the mass media and academic institutions. They have infiltrated many real socialist organisations and created many of their own fake ones. Divide and conquer is their primary strategy, if they perceive any divisions between socialist groups, they try to drive a wedge into it. When they build their own socialist organisations, the most common strategy is to spread ideas that sound socialistic, but are ultimately not at all useful. They will try to encourage a puritanical, vengeful, arrogant and self righteous mentality, any revolution that is less than perfect is bluntly dismissed, there is no constructive criticism or acknowledgement of the achievements of real viable socialist revolutions. They won't support any socialist experiments unless they failed, didn't last very long or didn't produce any measurable, lasting benefits to people's lives. The goal is to leave people with the feeling that communism is a Utopian fantasy, idealistic, unrealistic, a nice idea, but not practical. The bourgeoisie have also tried to meddle in the elections of countries where the population shows strong support for socialism, attempting to get more right wing candidates elected.

//       <h2>Cuba</h2>
//       <p>Thanks to the release of numerous formerly classified CIA documents, we now know the truth about Cuba. Most of the references for this article are directly from the website of the worst enemy of Socialism, the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States Government. There are many very rich and powerful people in this world who have strong motives for slandering Socialist countries like Cuba (especially Cuba) and hugely disproportionate access to mass mediums through which to spread these lies. The Communist Party of Cuba are radical humanists who have dramatically improved the quality of life of the the Cuban people. The government have taken large steps towards guaranteeing that all Cubans will have their basic needs met, massively reducing poverty and guaranteeing the necessities of life are affordable and in many cases provided for free at public expense. Housing, public transport, electricity, university, childcare and many other essential services are either free or cheap. The Communist party have greatly improved that status of African people and women, eliminating the worst aspects of racism and sexism. The standards of health and education are the best in the third world and in many ways as good or better than some first world countries. The Party created a much more fair and equitable distribution of wealth than Capitalist countries. Their private sector is largely worker-cooperatives, 30% of their GDP is produced by democratic businesses or self employed people where the workers are the shareholders. Their public sector is somewhat like an enormous co-operative in which all Cubans are a member and the goal is to meet human needs instead of generate profits. Their society is highly unionised with the vast majority of their people in at least one union and most work arrangements negotiated through unions. Recently, the sustainable development index found Cuba to be the most sustainable country in the world. </p>

//       <h2>Soviet Union</h2>
//       <p>The CIA archives also contain numerous documents that reveal the true nature of the USSR. The Soviet Union was actually quite progressive and humanistic for the time period. Their worst enemy admits this blatantly.
//       These are some facts we know about the USSR. It took several decades to develop Socialism, it took time to build the industry and technology that was needed. They also experienced a quite severe crisis: a civil war, numerous invasions and WW2. By the mid 20th century life in the Soviet Union became quite free. The USSR experienced very rapid economic growth, double that of the United States, this growth was targeted at raising the well being, health, education, wages and general living standards of the population. The socialist government massively reduced economic inequality. The highest rate of pay was only about three times higher than the lowest. In Capitalist Societies Bourgeois elites can make hundreds or thousands of times more money than working class people with income gained from exploiting workers. The government consciously tried to reduce the prices of things and the rates of unemployment (to make it easier for people to find jobs and increase economic growth) and were quite successful. All education was free and most university students were paid to study. Soviet citizens ate a slightly more nutritious diet than the United States’ population. The Soviet Union was highly feministic, with rates of female employment and enrolment at University roughly twice that of the USA. The communist government provided women with very cheap subsidised childcare services, paid maternity leave, divorce was easy to obtain, abortion was provided for free at public expense, the rates of infant mortality and teenage pregnancy were quite low. The criminal justice system in the USSR was aimed at rehabilitation. Prisoners were paid fairly well for their work, they were always adequately fed and they only worked the standard 8 hour day. Non-violent criminals were not confined to a cell. The USSR created a quality free universal healthcare system, one of the first in the world. The USSR built houses at a faster rate than any other country, they didn’t treat housing as a commodity but rather, as something everyone needs. It was the first country to more or less eliminate homelessness and their constitution guaranteed housing to all citizens. The USSR did not have exploitative or imperialistic economic relations with it’s trading partners, on the contrary, it gave huge amounts of financial aid, many billions of dollars worth.</p>

//       <p>
// The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) was a very encouraging experiment in Socialism that existed from 1945 to 1992. As with most other Communist countries, the CIA archives provide us with an abundance of valuable sources that tell a very clear story, one of massive improvements to the quality of life of the population. There were enormous gains in health, education, political participation, real wage growth and social equality. Yugoslavia had a very distinctive “self-management” system. This was much more decentralised than the Soviet Union, giving much more power to individual organisations, each of which was controlled by an elected worker council. Yugoslavia also experienced some economic difficulties that the USSR did not, inflation, higher unemployment and economic cycles. On the whole, despite it's faults, this Balkan Socialist country set a very promising example of what a world without exploitation, domination and imperialism could look like.

//       <h2>China</h2>
//       <p>
//       Capitalist historians would have us believe that the People's Republic of China experimented with Socialism for a few decades between 1949 and 1978, until finally realising that Capitalism was clearly superior to Communism and adopted a free market capitalist economy. Supposedly, all of China's problems resulted from Socialism and the huge progress China has made since the 1980s is entirely a result of Capitalism. This narrative is very misleading. It ignores the huge progress and growth made within Communist China prior to 1978. It excludes the fact that Communist leadership set China free from ruthless European Imperialism and Feudal Serfdom, that the standard of living, social and economic inequality dramatically reduced under Chairman Mao's Leadership. The status of women was greatly elevated, the commune system was organised in such a way as to liberate women from the need to perform unpaid domestic labour, the slavery of housework. Rates of female employment, university enrolment and leadership greatly increased (like most other socialist revolutions). Standards of health and education improved very substantially. The situation in China at the time of the Chinese revolution in 1949 was substantially worse than in Eastern Europe where the Soviet Revolution had occurred. Pre-communist China was one of the poorest countries in the world. Despite dramatic improvements, the poverty of the People's Republic persisted for several decades. In the late 1970s China was still far behind the Soviet Union and the First World countries in terms of development and wealth per capita. Gross Domestic Product per capita in the Soviet Union was 28 times higher than China, very few chinese people owned cars, televisions or even access to electricity. In order to address this problem more rapidly, the Communist government made some pragmatic compromises, allowing foreign capitalists to invest in China. This created an inflow of new technology that has greatly helped to increase productivity and efficiency. The countries of the former Soviet Union that have all adopted a Bourgeois type of parliament, heavily influenced by money and political lobbying, however China has retained a strong communist government that is much more resistant to corruption (although not completely). The communist party creates long term economic plans that allow them achieve huge goals that Capitalist governments are simply incapable of doing. Since the pro-capitalist reforms China has experienced the most rapid and consistent period of economic growth and poverty alleviation of any country in human history. No other country even comes sort of close. Yes China does now have some capitalist businesses, however the majority of their economy is still socialised, public enterprises and worker co-operatives.
