    <h1>Soviet Union</h1>
    <p>
    A great number of formerly classified CIA documents have revealed that the dominant narrative about the USSR being controlled by a tyrannical oligarchy is simply not true. The Soviet Union was actually quite progressive and humanistic for the time period. Their worst enemy admits this blatantly.
These are some facts we know about the USSR. It took several decades to develop Socialism, it took time to build the industry and technology that was needed. They also experienced a quite severe crisis: a civil war, numerous invasions and WW2. By the mid 20th century life in the Soviet Union became quite free. The USSR experienced very rapid economic growth, double that of the United States, this growth was targeted at raising the well being, health, education, wages and general living standards of the population. The socialist government massively reduced economic inequality. The highest rate of pay was only about three times higher than the lowest. In Capitalist Societies Bourgeois elites can make hundreds or thousands of times more money than working class people with income gained from exploiting workers. The government consciously tried to reduce the prices of things and the rates of unemployment (to make it easier for people to find jobs and increase economic growth) and were quite successful. All education was free and most university students were paid to study. Soviet citizens ate a slightly more nutritious diet than the United States’ population. The Soviet Union was highly feministic, with rates of female employment and enrolment at University roughly twice that of the USA. The communist government provided women with very cheap subsidised childcare services, paid maternity leave, divorce was easy to obtain, abortion was provided for free at public expense, the rates of infant mortality and teenage pregnancy were quite low. The criminal justice system in the USSR was aimed at rehabilitation. Prisoners were paid fairly well for their work, they were always adequately fed and they only worked the standard 8 hour day. Non-violent criminals were not confined to a cell. The USSR created a quality free universal healthcare system, one of the first in the world. The USSR built houses at a faster rate than any other country, they didn’t treat housing as a commodity but rather, as something everyone needs. It was the first country to more or less eliminate homelessness and their constitution guaranteed housing to all citizens. The USSR did not have exploitative or imperialistic economic relations with it’s trading partners, on the contrary, it gave huge amounts of financial aid, many billions of dollars worth.

    Wage Categories In Soviet Industry paragraph 1 “A continuous increase in work productivity and diminished production costs provide the Soviet Government with the opportunity of carrying out it's policy of lowering prices, which leads to a steady increase in real wages and to a further elevation in the nations standard of living.”
The highest pay grade was only about 2.6 times above the lowest. <a href="https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00809A000700070145-2.pdf">https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00809A000700070145-2.pdf</a>

    The Challenge of Soviet Economic Expansion page 2 para 5 “Our best estimates of Soviet domestic economic expansion place the average annual rate of growth of the Soviet Economy as a whole at between six and seven percent over the past eight years. Their industrial growth rate has averaged between eight and nine percent in this same time. Over the same period, our own average annual increase, both in Gross National Product and in Industrial Production, has been about three percent.” (ie. The rate of economic growth was twice as fast in the USSR than the USA, at least until the USA started to be aware of and retaliate to this immense threat.)

    The Employment Situation in the Soviet Union page 5 paragraph 3-4 “Extremely high participation of women in the Soviet Labour force, about 2 thirds of adult women as compared with only 1 third in the US.....Despite the overall success of the USSR in creating more jobs than are economically justifiable by western standards, substantial unemployment has persisted amongst some groups.” (i.e. The USSR has massively reduced the rate of unemployment, making it much easier for people to find a job.)

    Marriage and the Family in the USSR page 5 para 4 The abolition of private ownership of the means and instruments of production has freed the family from the evil influence of the cash nexus. Socialist society has brought the conditions for a really free marriage. Consolidation of the socialist system, the growing well-being of the people and the emancipation of women mean that the overwhelming majority of marriages in the USSR have nothing to do with the considerations of gain. Mutual love of man and woman and affection for children is the guiding force of marriage in the Soviet Union.

    Forced Labour in the USSR 1953-57 page 2 para 2 “The administration of the camp system has undergone a radical transformation since 1953, and the treatment of prisoners has improved substantially... It was decided some time in 1956 to convert all corrective labour camps into corrective labour “colonies”, where the principle emphasis would be on rehabilitating the prisoners and returning them speedily to civilian life rather than exploiting prison labour for economic purposes.” page 8 para 4 “About 1952-53 Soviet administrators evidently became convinced that economic progress in a modern industrial state must depend on the provision of incentives rather than the use of coercion.”

    Forced Labour Camps in the USSR; Transfer of Prisoners Between Camps Until 1952 prisoners were given a guaranteed amount of food, plus extra food for over-fulfilment of quotas. After 1952, prisoners were paid according to the amount of work completed. For over-fulfilling the quotas by 105%, one day of sentence was counted as two, thus reducing the sentence of criminals. Until 1954, prisoners worked 10 hour days, after 1954 their work day was reduced to the normal 8 hour day worked by most soviet citizens. 95% of gulag prisoners were actual criminals.

    A US Academy of Political Science, of which several former Presidents are honorary members, published an article in which they claim that the Soviet Union housing was treated as a social good instead of a commodity. The USSR built houses at a faster rate than any other country and their 1977 constitution guaranteed housing to everyone as a human right. Morton, Henry W. “Housing in the Soviet Union.” Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science 35, no. 3 (1984): 69–80. https://doi.org/10.2307/1174118.

    Clearly, the Soviet Union was not governed by a terrible authoritarian regime. It may not have been Utopia, but they took many substantial steps in the right direction. Notice the very stark difference between how the Soviet Union is portrayed in the Capitalist media and education systems. At school I was just taught that the USSR was a terrible authoritarian country were everyone lived in poverty and the government murdered or enslaved everyone who disagreed with their ideology. This is clearly slander. 
    </p>
    <p>
    I cannot discredit every single allegation that has been made about the USSR and there certainly were mistakes made along the way. It wasn’t perfect. Probably the most credible allegation is that of homophobia, male gay sex was made illegal in 1934 (like most countries at the time). This was certainly a problem, however it is not constructive to just bluntly dismiss all of the huge achievements because of these errors. Overall, the Soviet Union was a very positive thing for working class people around the world and this is why the ruling class have slandered socialism so terribly. We must take allegations about socialism with a grain of salt. There are many people who have very strong motives for slandering the USSR, particularly the rulers of capitalist countries. Our politicians do not consciously plan to try to raise people wages, reduce unemployment, or to ensure everyone has a home. By all these indicators, the situation has been growing much worse since the 1970s in Australia. The numerous war crimes and instances of mass murder committed by the armies of Capitalist governments are well documented.

    Revolutions always happen in the real world with real people. The people involved are always imperfect human beings, living in a very imperfect world. When the USSR was born, Russia was a very poor, mostly feudal country. Most of the population were illiterate peasants, there would be occasional famines. The leadership of the Bolshevik Party was responsible for ending this terrible situation. The first priority of the party was to try to increase the standard of living, educate the people and industrialise as fast as possible in order to be able to compete with the western capitalist countries. If Stalin had not pushed for very rapid industrialisation, the Soviet Union would not have been strong enough to survive the threat of Fascism in Europe and Russia would have been destroyed in WW2. We know this because we can compare the Soviet Union with other socialist experiments that were more “libertarian”, like the Spanish Libertarian revolution in 1936 and the Paris Commune. These revolutions, while perhaps more directly democratic were quickly crushed by hostile external imperialist forces. The USSR survived, produced a viable lasting form of socialism that massively improved the lives of hundreds of millions of people. It is important to keep in mind that what is ideal and what is practical are two separate things.

    It is misleading to say the USSR was “authoritarian”. It is much more accurate to say it had strong responsible leadership. There can be valid reasons to exclude people from political participation for the sake of their own protection. For example, my grandmother just believes women are supposed to be housewives. Even though I am a man, I know she is obviously wrong, women have huge potential and are overall, just as amazing as men. Should we let her drag other women down with her? A bunch of illiterate peasants who struggle to even meet their own basic needs, simply to not have the knowledge and competence for organising a revolution. It's not their fault, they've been oppressed terribly by their feudal lords, but realistically they just don't know what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
    Power does have a very strong tendency to corrupt people. We need to be wary of this, however realistically, revolutions require some sort of leadership. Our modern world is far too complicated for a direct form of democracy to be practical on a huge scale with millions of people.
    </p>
    <p>
    We need to try to learn from the experiences of the USSR and other Socialist countries. They have found much better ways of choosing leaders who are more responsible, sympathetic and ethical. We need to try to use modern technology to try to enhance the strengths of socialism and give each other more freedom and democracy. This is why we have tried to build the democratic-social-network.
