    <h1>Soviet Union</h1>
    <p>
    A great number of formerly classified CIA documents have revealed that the Soviet Union was actually quite progressive and humanistic for the time period. Their worst enemy admits this blatantly. It took several decades to develop Socialism, it took time to build the industry and technology that was needed. They also experienced a quite severe crisis: a civil war, numerous invasions and WW2. By the mid 20th century life in the Soviet Union became quite free. The USSR experienced very rapid economic growth, double that of the United States, this growth was targeted at raising the well being, health, education, wages and general living standards of the population. The socialist government massively reduced economic inequality. The highest rate of pay was only about three times higher than the lowest. The government consciously tried to reduce the prices of things and the rates of unemployment (to make it easier for people to find jobs and increase economic growth) and were quite successful. All education was free and most university students were paid to study. Soviet citizens ate a slightly more nutritious diet than the United States’ population. The Soviet Union was highly feminist, with rates of female employment and enrolment at University roughly twice that of the USA. The communist government provided women with very cheap subsidised childcare services, paid maternity leave, divorce was easy to obtain, abortion was provided for free at public expense, the rates of infant mortality and teenage pregnancy were quite low. The criminal justice system in the USSR was aimed at rehabilitation. Prisoners were paid fairly well for their work, they were always adequately fed and they only worked the standard 8 hour day. Non-violent criminals were not confined to a cell. The USSR created a quality free universal healthcare system, one of the first in the world. The USSR built houses at a faster rate than any other country, they didn’t treat housing as a commodity but rather, as something everyone needs. It was the first country to more or less eliminate homelessness and their constitution guaranteed housing to all citizens. The USSR did not have exploitative or imperialistic economic relations with it’s trading partners, on the contrary, it gave huge amounts of financial aid, many billions of dollars worth.

     Communist leadership in the Soviet Union created a much more humanistic economic system that was better at meeting the needs of the population that Capitalism. Capitalist governments actively try to expand inequality and exploit the population as much as they can get away with. The Bolsheviks did not. Developed Socialist society was characterised by the plan based growth of the economy, the dynamic development of key economic sectors, and, the corresponding increases in public well-being (ref #1). Real wages almost doubled between 1965 and 1980 then stagnated early 1980s. Labour productivity in agriculture and industry tended to increase between 1966 and 1980
    (ref #2). A continuous increase in work productivity and diminished production costs provided the Soviet Government with the opportunity of carrying out it's policy of lowering prices, which lead to a steady increase in real wages and to a further elevation in the nations standard of living. The highest pay grade was only about 2.6-3 times above the lowest (ref#3. In the 1950s the average annual rate of economic growth was between six and seven percent and the industrial growth rate averaged between eight and nine percent. Over the same period, the United States' average annual increase, both in Gross National Product and in Industrial Production, was about three percent (ref #4). Economic planning brought a massive reduction in the rate of unemployment, making it much easier to find a job and to change job (ref #5). The Soviet Union ha a relatively high level of employment (ref #6). A US Academy of Political Science, of which several former Presidents are honorary members, published an article in which they claim that the Soviet Union housing was treated as a social good instead of a commodity. The USSR built houses at a faster rate than any other country and their 1977 constitution guaranteed housing to everyone as a human right (ref #7). House rent was on average about 5% of a workers salary. In order to help people build their own homes, the government would give an advance payment of one and a half times a year's pay to be re-payed over five years with no interest charged (ref #8). Collective farms were established where 30-800 individual farms would come together and all the basic means of production, land, livestock, implements, buildings and amenities. Of the income derived from the sale of farm produce to the state, 65% was distributed to the workers according to their working-day units; 35% went towards the development of the farm. An income tax of 6% was charged of each worker. The administration of the collective farm was carried out by the manager who was elected for four years by members by representatives elected by the farmers. Collective farms had creches, kindergarten schools, schools, maternity shelters and small hospital units and sometimes hospitals. (ref #9). The lowest paid workers usually belonged to collectives where they got their food and other necessities relatively cheaply (ref #10). Travel and public utility services such as water, lighting, electricity and buses were very cheap (ref #11). In 1955 all workers received at least three weeks holiday per year depending on  the level or stress involved in their career (ref #12). Every man above age 60 and every woman above age 55 received a monthly pension of 40% of the average pay per month of his or her working year. Elderly people may also choose to continue to work and receive full pay plus the pension (ref #13). Pensions for disability were granted to workers after examinations by labor medical expert commissions. Invalids who have suffered from industrial accidents or trade diseases are paid up to 100% of their previous earnings (ref #14). Widespread measures were taken by the government in order to improve living conditions, including housing and municipal development on an unparalleled scale and the improvement of amenities in populated places. There were huge state appropriations for social insurance benefits, pensions, cost-free or part-free accommodation at sanatoria, holiday homes and children's establishments, aid to mothers of large families and unmarried mothers, free medical aid and other measures aimed at improving the well-being of the working people, have had a beneficial effect on the health of Soviet citizens . In 1954 alone the state spent 146,000 million rubles on allowances and other social benefits. For the first time in history, society- free of exploitation of man by man – was putting efforts into harmoniously developing man's personality, physical and moral strength and capacity and into bringing up a healthy generation (ref #15). The government also spent large sums of money on health resorts, rest homes, pioneer camps, outdoor recreation, children's clubs, sporting areas, ski bases, bathing beaches and physical culture schools are being constructed and equipped from social insurance funds. The Government increased social insurance over time, 10.4 billion rubles in the first five year plan, 32.5 billion rubles in the second plan, 35 billion for the third and 80 billion for th efourth plan. The 1952 budget was 2.6 times larger than the 1940 budget. The fifth plan increased the budget 30%. In 1953 230 million rubles were spent on building and equipping trade union sanatoria. 200 million rubles were allocated for restoration, repair and equipment of cultural and educational institutions, physical culture installations, tourist bases and for organization of tours and trips to alpine camps (ref #16).
    <br/>
    Socialism brought enormous improvements to the standard of health. In 1900, before the socialist revolution, there was one physician per 25000 of the population and one medical station of 50 to 300 beds per 36000 of the population. The death rate was about 30 per 1000 and the infant mortality rate was 244 per 1000. In 1918, the People's Ministry of Health was established as a central body for the purposes of providing qualified health and medical services, free of charge, to all workers, the carry out public health measures for all including sanitation, establishment of communal feeding with a healthy diet, to prevent contagious diseases and social diseases (like alcoholism). (ref #17). By 1955 there number of doctors had risen to one per thousand  of the population (ref #18). Thee USSR had a high standard of hygiene as a result of systemic and planned education work (and nutritional status (ref #19). Many contagious diseases were almost or completely eradicated by the mid 1950s including Malaria, Cholera, Smallpox, Plague, Venereal disease and Typhus (ref #20, ref #21). Rates of infant mortality reduced from 250 per thousand to between 10 and 20 per thousand (ref #22). Preventative medicine has a high priority. Curative medicine, especially in the fields of neuro-surgery, cardiac surgery and anaesthesia had advanced far (ref #23). Problems of overcrowding and undernourishment had been resolved by the 1950s despite a rapidly increasing population size (ref #24). In 1983  American and Soviet citizens ate about the same amount of food each day but the Soviet Diet may have been more nutritious (ref #25). There was considerable reduction in sickness incidence and mortality. In 1953 the number of deaths registered was one third of the figure from 1913. In 1953 the death rate was lower than that of Britain, the United States and France (ref #26). The Soviet State budget covered all public health expenditure. In 1940 this amounted to 11,200 million rubles, by 1953 this figure was 2.5 times higher (ref #27). The Soviet government invested hugely in medical research. By 1956 the Union had 84 medical institutes, 259 medical research centres with 15000 scientific workers. Before the Russian revolution there had been very few of these facilities (ref #28).
    <br/>
    The standards of education improved dramatically under the leadership of the communist party. Illiteracy was wiped out. By the mid 1950s there was compulsory and free education up the seventh grade throughout the union and this was later raised to ten years. In the 1950s most of the students of higher education were subsidised by the state or by firms. Every child had to learn three languages, Russian and two other foreign languages. Schools tried to instil children with a love of national music, folk and ballet dancing, art and architecture. Science was a compulsory subject in schools (ref #29). By the 1980s the Soviet government provided tuition free schooling at all levels and stipends for more than 70 of full time students of higher or special secondary education. The majority of higher education students were actually paid to study and all education was at least free (ref #30). Scholarships and stipends served to channel students into desired study areas. Scientific and engineering students received more rubles per month than students of history (ref #31). The state assigned all new graduates with jobs. In the USA only 60% of science graduates worked in their fields while in the USSR it was 80% (ref #32). As early as 1935 the USSR awarded 18000 candidate degrees, their equivalent of a PHD, while the USA only awarded 15000 PHDs (ref #33). Scientists were regarded as very high status, as were research and laboratory workers (ref #34). The economic plans also aimed to meet the cultural needs of the population. By 1955 the Soviet Union had built 390000 libraries with 1.3 billion volumes. In the same year, 70 theatres in Czechoslovakia staged 26230 performances, with 12.8 million attendees. In Hungary 11700 theatre and opera performance were attended by approximately 6.6 million people. Radio Ownership increased dramatically (ref #35). By 1956 the USA and USSR both had a scientific technical labour force of about 1.2 million. The Soviet Union graduated many more scientists and engineers than the USA each year, 60% of students as compared to 25% of students in the United States. There was also substantially more science education in Soviet high schools, at least 5 years of physics, chemistry and biology. Less than 10% of American high school students took even one year of physics or chemistry (ref #36). Soviet leaders trained the largest scientific and engineering manpower force in the world (ref #37). The Soviets had made enormous advances in scientific discovery,  particularly in nuclear research with particle accelerators, aircraft, electric digital computers and telecommunications (ref #38) (ref #39). In 1956 the CIA noted that Soviet science was improving rapidly. While not quite as good yet, it would soon overtake the USA (ref #40).
    <br/>
     Bolshevism was a highly feminist ideology with the firm belief that men and women both have equally great potential. Article 122 of the Soviet Constitution said: “Women in the USSR are accorded equal rights with men in all spheres of economic, government, cultural, political and other public activity. The possibility of exercising these rights is ensured by women being accorded an equal right with men to work, payment for work, rest and leisure, social insurance and education, and by state protection of the interests of mother and child, state aid to mothers of large families and unmarried mothers, maternity leave with full pay and the provision of a wide network of maternity homes, nurseries and kindergartens.”(ref #41). The government had a number of policies to help empower women, There was extremely high participation of women in the Soviet labour force and tertiary education, about two thirds of adult women as compared with only one third in the US (ref #42). In urban areas, this figure was as high as 90% of women being employed or studying. Female wages were raised substantially. The government assisted mothers with free medical services, child care facilities, paid maternity leave, family allowance payments, it's policy with respect to abortion was liberal and divorce was relatively easy to obtain (ref #43). The abolition of private ownership of the means and instruments of production freed the family from the evil influence of the cash nexus. Socialist society brought the conditions for a really free marriage. Consolidation of the socialist system, the growing well-being of the people and the emancipation of women meant that the overwhelming majority of marriages in the USSR had nothing to do with the considerations of gain. Mutual love of man and woman and affection for children was the guiding force of marriage in the Soviet Union (ref #44). Polygamy was wiped out (ref #45). Prostitution was officially abolished. The socio-economic causes leading to prostitution were removed by the control of girls migrating to cities without proper reason; by giving them suitable employment and therefore economic security; by keeping their minds occupied and their bodies tired by constructive work, giving gradually increasing freedom in social life until they had adjusted themselves to their new environment. This also resulted in enormous reductions in sexually transmitted disease (ref #46). Mothers received 120 ruble grants on the birth of each child for the purchase of clothing and could also 90 rubles per month for nine months for incidentals towards baby feeding. For the birth of her third child, mothers received 400 rubles and 1300 for the fourth; this rate gradually increased until the 10th child  and above that 8000 rubles per child. In the 1950s mothers received paid maternity leave with full pay for at least 72 days, sometimes more if a doctor advised this was necessary. There were noticeably much fewer crying babies, apparently because their needs were better taken care of (ref #47).
    <br/>
     The way the Soviet Union interacted with other countries was vastly more humanistic and fair than the way European Imperialist countries behaved. They attempted to form mutually beneficial relationships, although they tried to impose their ideology to some extent. USSR foreign policy was aimed towards developing and strengthening the economies of their allies, rather than oppressing and exploiting other countries. “The theory that the Soviet Union exploits Eastern 'Europe's Eastern Europe through the imposition of discriminatory terms of trade-is not supported by the facts. A recent trade study concluded that the Soviet Union has granted Eastern Europe large trade subsidies, averaging $4.8 billion dollars between 1974-78 and rising to 10.4 billion in 1979 and a staggering 20.1 billion in 1980“ (ref #48).  Soviet assistance mainly took the form of implicit subsidies from exports of primary commodities at below global market prices, imports at above market prices and trade surpluses. They paid generous prices for Eastern European manufactured products (ref #49). USSR prices were roughly 30% cheaper than global prices (ref #50). There was little ambiguity as to the existence of a substantial soviet economic burden from economic and military support of other communist countries, especially Cuba and Vietnam. The Soviets provided Cuba and Vietnam with all their military and most of their economic import requirements and got very little of economic value in return although they obtained large military and political benefits. The value of Soviet assistance to these two countries was in the range of $4 to $8 billion USD (ref #51). Moscow provided direct grants for economic or military purposes almost exclusively to communist countries, 2 billion dollars a year during 1980-82. The USSR also provided credits to finance economic development, trade and military purchases. Most of these credits were on highly concessionary terms, although the subsidy element varied greatly from year to year because Soviet credit terms changed little while world market interest rates showed large swings. Interest rates ran from 2 to 7 percent. They appeared to be fairly similar for communist country and non-communist LDC recipients (ref #52).  Vietnam received large amounts of free military assistance, $1.5 billion a year and the cost to non communist states like Angola, Ethiopia, Mozambique and South Yemen is between $1-2 billion dollars a year. Much of this was likely to be only partly repaid (ref #53). The burden of keeping some of the non-contiguous communist countries, notably Cuba and Vietnam, in the Soviet Empire, almost certainly did entail substantial net costs to the Soviet economy. (ref #54).  There is an extremely well documented history of ruthless western European imperialism, the numerous instances of genocide, usury, ruthless exploitation of slave and wage labour, and natural resources. There is no doubt the Soviet Union was a genuinely internationalist system that vastly more humane than the Western European empires that have dominated the Earth since the early modern period.

    The Soviet Union created a fairly humane criminal justice system. The prison system evolved and improved throughout the history of the USSR. In the second half of the 20th century the prison system became much more focused on rehabilitating criminals. Previously, while almost all prisoners were actual criminals, thieves, rapists, murderers etc, prison labour had been aimed primarily towards developing the economy and industrialisation. By the 1950s the USSR had built enough machinery to ensure that the needs of the population could mostly be met, eliminating famines, homelessness and preventable diseases. The government then focused on creating a prison system that help criminals rebuild their lives. Inmates were paid fairly well, they could study new careers and were given decent opportunities for the sort of social interactions that are needed for mental health such as visits from friends and family. The Bolsheviks understood that forced labour was inefficient because people work with much more enthusiasm doing jobs they have chosen for themselves. Economic planning became much more focused on providing incentives than the use of coercion (ref #55). Prisoners were given a guaranteed amount of food, plus extra food for over-fulfilment of quotas. After 1952, prisoners were paid according to the amount of work completed. For over-fulfilling the quotas by 105%, one day of sentence was counted as two, thus reducing the sentence of criminals. Until 1954, prisoners worked 10 hour days, after 1954 their work day was reduced to the normal 8 hour day worked by most soviet citizens. 95% of gulag prisoners were ordinary criminals. While only 5% were "political criminals", many of which were actual fascists (ref #56). Conditions of confinement were humane and not substandard relative to the surrounding community. The facility was clean and orderly, and administered in a professional manner with a balance of compassion and discipline, order and personal freedom, and opportunities for people to improve themselves, improve their surroundings, and keep productively occupied during their sentences. (ref #57). Prisoners appeared productively employed in work that did not appear either to be exploitative or generally regarded by the inmates as a form of punishment (ref #58).

    As you can plainly see, Socialist leadership vastly improved the lives of the population living in the Soviet Union. The suggestion that the USSR had an authoritarian, tyrannical government is incorrect. It is much more accurate to say that they had strong responsible leadership. People also greatly appreciated the improved quality of life and were largely co-operative with the governments leadership.  Another Central Intelligence Agency investigation found that “All the workers that we met appeared to be very proud of their country and their individual and collective works and kept asking how we liked Russia, compared with the other countries that we had visited. They talked enthusiastically about working for the betterment of the nation, and about peaceful living in order to keep up a steady progress towards health and enjoyment.” (ref #59). Even today, polls gathered by Capitalist news organisations like the Moscow Times have shown there remains strong nostalgia for the USSR, one found that 75% of Russians consider the Soviet Union to have been the greatest time ever in the history of the country (ref #60). In the 1991 Soviet Referendum, 77.85% of Soviet people voted to maintain the Union (ref #61).
    <br/>
    Most of the CIA sources for this article so far have mostly been about the USSR during the second half of the 20th century, from the tail end of the Stalin Era until the death of the Union. At this point it should be quite clear that the Soviet Union had become a highly humanistic political, economic and social system that was much better at meeting the needs of the population than Capitalism . However, what about the supposedly evil tyrant Joseph Stalin? There are also very strong reasons to believe that Stalin has been slandered terribly. His leadership was perhaps somewhat more coercive and forceful than later Soviet leaders, however this was largely a result of the circumstances and not his personal character. All governments become more authoritarian during a crisis and the USSR experienced terrible crisis for the first few decades, a brutal civil war and later the threat of Fascism. All feudal societies experience the on going crises of fairly regular famines and epidemics (ref #62)(ref #63). It was necessary to industrialise as rapidly as possible to ensure the Union would be strong enough to survive capitalist and fascist aggression and to eliminate famines and epidemics. If they hadn't, the USSR would have been swiftly destroyed as were numerous other socialist revolutions that were more libertarian or directly democratic, like the Spanish Libertarian revolution in 1936 and the Paris Commune. There are CIA documents that acknowledge where they acknowledge the suggestion that Stalin was a dictator is an overstatement. “Even in Stalin's time there was collective leadership. The western idea of a dictator in the communist setup is exaggerated. Stalin, although holding wide powers, was merely the captain of a team” (ref #64). After WW2, particularly during the leadership of Stalin's successor, Nikita Krushchev, the Communist party became more openly critical of Stalin, acknowledging numerous mistakes made by the former leader. Krushchev famously delivered a speech 'On The Cult Of Personality And It's Consequences',  in which he slandered Joseph Stalin terribly, accusing him of being an autocratic tyrant who ruthlessly tortured and killed anyone who questioned his leadership. The is a very well written book called Krushchev Lied by Grover Furr in which the author comprehensively disproves every single allegation made in the speech. It seems the party was using Stalin as a scapegoat to conceal and divert attention away from embarrassing mistakes and oversights made by the party in general, particularly Krushchev himself. There had been a conspiracy within the communist party to destroy the Soviet Union, foreign agents had infiltrated the organisation. Some of these traitors abused their authority in order to try to conceal their involvement in this conspiracy, ordering unjust executions and using torture to draw false confessions from innocent people. Stalin himself was not involved, of course he would not conspire to destroy the political system in which he was supposedly the all powerful tyrannical dictator. The Communist party was embarrassed that this conspiracy had gotten so out of hand and that there were so many unjust convictions that had escaped their notice. In the years after Stalin died, there was a very large amnesty for many unfairly incarcerated criminals. The memoirs of most of the people who worked closely with Stalin (including Krushchev's) portray his character as tough but fair, he was the sort of person who would frequently change his mind if presented with a persuasive argument and he himself would try his best to convince others rather than impose his own will. There is another CIA document called The Course of De-Stalinization In Soviet Domestic Propaganda Through June 1956 which seems to display an awareness that the Communist party judged Stalin excessively harshly in the years following his death. The document describes this anti-stalin trend as “defamation”, “denigration” and “scapegoating” (ref #65). It also seems likely that Krushchev lied so terribly about his predecessor in order to gain favour with the United States. After World War Two the USA had gained a level of power vastly greater than any other Empire in history. The United States accounted for 50 percent of global GDP, held 80 percent of the world’s hard currency reserves, and was a net exporter of petroleum products. (ref #66)(ref #67). They also had by far the most powerful weapons, nuclear bombs, which they had demonstrated they were willing to use. Portraying Stalin as a tyrannical dictator was a way of appeasing the USA.
      <br/>  
    In conclusion, the Soviet Union may not have been a Utopia, but they took some very substantial steps in the right direction. They successfully created a new system that was vastly more humanistic than any that had preceded it. Rational economic long term planning massively improved the lives of the population by any meaningful measurable standard. There were dramatic improvements to health, education, wage growth, reductions in the cost of living and unemployment rates. There were vast improvements in social equality, elimination of the worst aspects of sexism, racism and ethnic or national chauvinism. The Soviet Economy was driven by the motive of improving the lives of the population, instead of to making profits for a tiny oligarchy.
